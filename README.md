 - Created a `Project`
 - Accidentally created a GitHub IO Page: https://peter201943.github.io/Peter-Brain/


## Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/peter201943/Peter-Brain/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.


## Credits

I like a lot of stuff. Hopefully I have cited most of it. This is where the fractal is from: https://www.deviantart.com/element90/art/Three-Wire-Gnarls-350251561
